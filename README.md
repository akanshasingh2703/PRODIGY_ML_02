## Introduction

Customer segmentation is the process of dividing customers into groups based on common characteristics. This project uses K-Means clustering to group customers based on their annual income and spending score. Such segmentation can help in targeting different groups with personalized marketing strategies.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the "Mall Customers" dataset, which can be found on Kaggle. The dataset includes information about customers such as:

- CustomerID
- Gender
- Age
- Annual Income (k$)
- Spending Score (1-100)

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn



## Results

The results of the clustering is displayed as a scatter plot, showing the different clusters of customers based on their annual income and spending score.


## Conclusion

This project successfully demonstrates how to apply K-Means clustering for customer segmentation. The resulting clusters can be used to tailor marketing strategies to different customer groups, thereby enhancing customer satisfaction and business performance.
